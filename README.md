  ### Utilities
 - Each script should be either input into the console or used as a tampermonkney script.
 - Most the scripts are self explanatory by their name, such as 3rd person(makes you be in 3rd person)
 - LogoInstall opens a new button, and once you click it, you input a link, and that becomes the logo
 - Try out more and play with it!
  ### Css
  - All of the css is to be loaded as a unpacked extention.
  - If you like it, I can add more. 
  - There are some very good ones there
  - ENJOY!
